The question is same as [##22](https://github.com/aqu106/Code/blob/master/Geeks%20For%20Geeks/Strings/%23%2322.%20Smallest%20window%20in%20a%20string%20containing%20all%20the%20characters%20of%20another%20string/%231.%20hashing.cpp)
. The only difference being here we have to explicitily create a `pattern` string with help of `text` string and then return the length ,
whereas in `##22` we were given both `text` and `pattern` string and we needed to ouput the desired string .
