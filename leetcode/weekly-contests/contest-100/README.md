* Date : 30th July , 2022

* Solved :

    * [X] 896. Monotonic Array
    * [X] 897. Increasing Order Search Tree

* Upsolve :

    * [X] 898. Bitwise ORs of Subarrays
    * [ ] 899. Orderly Queue

* Comments :

* 896. Monotonic Array :
    * Solved it in 2 pass . First checked for monotonic increasing and then for monotonic decreasing .

* 897. Increasing Order Search Tree :
    * Solved it with inorder traversal as the question suggested .
    * Solution can be cleaned further by creating the **answer** tree while doing inorder traversal itself .

* 898. Bitwise ORs of Subarrays :
    * Solved it after the contest with help from discussion .
    * Good question for practicing bit operators .
